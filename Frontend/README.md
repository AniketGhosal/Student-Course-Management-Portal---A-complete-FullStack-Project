# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

DAY 1 Installing Node and React.


DAY 2 Making UI interface for the project for better visualization and coding.


DAY 3 Coding and creating Frontend page of the website.


DAY 4 SATURDAY - 06/09/2025

1st report: Added Login and Sign Up Pages (Using Login, user will redirected to their dashboard from where they can easily track their courses. If they don't have any account, then they are easily create an account using Sign Up functionality).

2nd Report: In this half, I focused on PostgreSQL. I followed its full Documentation to learn PostgreSQL database. Focusing on its architecture, ACID compliance, and object-relational model. Clearly understood the differences between PostgreSQL and MySQL. Learned its advance datatype, different types of queries. The PostgreSQL was successfully installed and configured. Then exlpored its interface and database object management.

3rd Report: In this half, I am continuing with the PostgreSQL documentation. Learning Indexing, Joins, multiple functionality base operation etc. Also designing the UI portion of Course tab (in this course tab, multiple courses are displayed, which will easily be enrolled from the student side. Using React Router and API feature, this page can easily accessable from the Homepage).



DAY 5 MONDAY - 08/09/2025

1st Report: Started the Backend portion for the project. Reading the documentation for Backend setup with Node.js. Studied its event-driven architecture, non-blocking I/O model, and modules like 'http' and 'fs'. Also studied about Request and Response feature of Node.js.

2nd Report: Continuing with the Backend portion. Setting up different modules in Backend for handling Frontend.

3rd Report: Doing some changes in Login and SignUp module. Create database schemas named - Student, Enrollements and Admin in PostgreSQL. Connecting multiple module - Home, Courses & Pricing, Contact Us with React Router feature.



DAY 6 TUESDAY - 09/09/2025

1st Report: Continuing with backend setup with Node.js. Creating first server using Node.js and successfully tested using 'req()' and 'res()' methods.



DAY 7 WEDNESDAY - 10/09/2025

1st Report: Started with the backend portion. Today's focus is on storing Login and SignUp data in the database and then, using Backend functionality Student's and Admin's are redirected to their portal. Managing Database for this and connecting it with the backend.

2nd Report: Installed Express and setup module with it. Designing UI for Admin panel for implementation.

3rd Report: Completed the design of Database. Implementing connection of 'SignUp' button i.e., when User will click SignUp button and give their details, their given data will be stored in the database and that data will be easily accessable from PostgreSQL database.



DAY 8 THURSDAY - 11/09/2025

1st Report: Started with the backend again. Today's focus is on to handle Admin panel and Student Panel simultaneously i.e., Student's are redirected to their student interface and Admin's are redirected to their Admin panel interface.

2nd Report: Continuing coding for Student and Admin panel functionality.

3rd Report: Successfully implemented Student portal connection with Login functionality. It means, students successfully logged in their portal with valid credentials.




DAY 9 MONDAY - 15/09/2025

1st Report: Successfully added Student Dashboard and Admin Dashboard with 'Login' button. Using 'Login' button, Student's now redirected to their student dashboard portal with their credentials and Admin's are redirected to their admin dashboard portal with their credentials.
